## Team Meetings
[Home](README.md)

You will schedule two types of weekly meetings:  

* A general meeting so all group members can attend if possible.
  * Approximately 1 hour
  * Review what has been done since last week
  * Make collective decisions about your project
  * Delegate new work
  * Meeting minutes must be taken, made available to TA.  
    
* A meeting of 3 or 4 members of your team and your teamâ€™s TA 
  * TA allocated for 30 minutes per week, per team
  * The general and TA meetings may coincide/overlap (recommended)
  * Your TA meeting must be held in Middlesex College

**You must work with your TA to schedule a weekly meeting time.**

It is the team's responsibility to take leadership of all meetings and engage the TA.

You can book meeting/collaborative space in Middlesex College with Cheryl in the CSD main office.
Using a Doodle poll including your TA is recommended.
