## Team Project

An overview of general information about the team project. 

### Stage 0

By Midnight on January 18th, you must organize, meet as a team, and discuss your choice of project. 
You will submit a high-level project proposal of at most one page.

Your project proposal should begin with a short description of your intended project.
Describe what the main functionality of your application will be, and state whether it will be a desktop or web-based application
Remember, web-based applications are highly encouraged, but very well-implemented desktop applications will still be eligible for full marks.

Describe the primary features your application will have, and how you plan to implement them. For example

> Our market trends visualization tool will enable users to visualize market prices over time by using a combination 
> of free historical and real-time data from Yahoo Finance and QuantQuote APIs. Users will be able to view custom graphs and charts
> showing the relationship between multiple stock prices over time. Charts will be generated using the free Google Charts API.

Notice how the feasibility of the proposed feature is supported by cititing APIs. At this phase you don't need to specifically 
cite any APIs, but you should show us that you have at least considered the feasibility of your proposed features and have done
some basic research on how it might be implemented.

Organize your document by primary features, and briefly elaborate on each in its own section. You may also propose an advanced
feature. This might be a more difficult to implement feature that will be contigent on successful implementation of primary features.
If you propose an advanced feature, you must ensure that none of your primary features depend on the advanced feature. For example

> As an advanced feature, we propose to implement a Sentiment Analysis Tool that will alert the user if a particular stock, commodity, etc.
> is being discussed heavily on social media sites with free APIs. The successful implementation of this feature would require
> significant research and implementation effort and is experimental in nature. The other features of our program will not depend
> on the implementation of this feature, and its development will only be pursued if our TA is satisfied with our progress.

Note that the above is just an example. This would be a *very* advanced feature, and nothing this advanced is expected from you.
With that in mind, though, you are encouraged to be creative. Even if you do not end up pursuing your advanced feature,
