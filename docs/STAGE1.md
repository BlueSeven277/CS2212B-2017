## Stage 0

[Home](README.md)  

***Due Friday February 10th at Midnight***

In this Stage, your team will do the first steps of the high level design of your software for the team project.  

Your team will create several pages for your website. Websited should be hosted using GitHub Pages from your 
team's main GitHub repository.

You will also create documents for User Stories and Tasks and submit them by e-mail to your TA and Ethan.

### Required Web Pages  

Your project website will be used to introduce your team and your project to the world. You will update your website
throughout the project to reflect your progress. Part of a suitable role for a team member would be to maintain the site.  

At the deadline, your website must include:

* Home Page  
* Team Roster Page  
* Software Design Page  
* UI Design Page  
* Project Plan Page  

Each page should be titled appropriately and be clearly organized. Keep the content simple and uncluttered.

### Home Page  

Include your team name and number (e.g. InterSlice - CS 2212 Team X) and a brief description of the project you are developing.  

### Team Roster Page  

The page must include a list of all your team's members and a brief summary of each member's skills/background/hobbies/philosophy/whatever. You should also list any roles or responsibilities that have been delegated
to members (e.g. Code Champion, Repo Hero, Database Ace, Team Overseer, UX Guru, etc.) Be creative!

### Software Design Page  

This page will outline the design of your project and will consist, for now, of a UML class diagram. More details below.

### UI Design Page  

Write a brief description of the look and feel you want your program to have, or cite an existing design language (e.g. minimal, Material Design, flat design, etc.) You could also cite an existing application or website as a source of inspiration. Describe at a very high level how users will interact with your software.  

This page should also include mock-ups of screens or views you plan to include in your application. You should use, at the very least, a vector graphics based drawing tool to create examples. You could also use photos of a whiteboard drawing as long as they are *exceptionally* clear and easy to understand. Better yet, why not search for a free mock-up tool online to generate these for you? You might find something useful.

No matter the format, ensure that your UI Design Page portrays the intended interfaces for all of your application's user facing features.
