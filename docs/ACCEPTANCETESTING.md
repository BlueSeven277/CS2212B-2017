## Acceptance Testing  
**March 27th to 31st - Schedule and Room TBA**

[Home](README.md)  

Your team will attend a 30 to 45-minute evaluation session with Ethan and your TA. We will test your software and expect your team to answer questions about your project. 
We will ask questions about your code, tools and frameworks you have used, design decisions, team dynamics, and more. As many team members as possible should attend. Though you may have primary presenters, each person in attendance should tell us something about their role in the project.  

## Functional Testing

Part of the session will be used to test your software.  

### Build and Run

Only the code cloned from your repository on Friday March 24th will be used for testing. You must demonstrate the build process during the acceptance testing session.

If you are using IntelliJ, you are expected to:  
- Use the cloned code to create a new IntelliJ repository from sources / importing a Gradle project
- Build the project from the cloned source code
- Run the application (frontend and backend) on the same system using localhost for all within-app network communication

If you are not using IntelliJ, you must:  
- Build the project from the cloned source code either from a new IDE project or by using command-line tools
- Run the application (frontend and backend) on the same system using localhost for all within-app network communication

If this process does not work during acceptance testing, then the maximum grade your team can receive for the program functionality portion of Stage 3 marking is 45%.

### Testing

We will test your project against the Stage 3 Spec you received from your TA. We will also be testing non-functional elements, and evaluting the user experience. This is your chance to show us how to use your software properly and explain any errors, missing data, etc. 

It is your responsibility to walk us through each of the features from your Stage 3 spec you have implemented (completely or partially). Show us everything you have achieved, even if it doesn't work exactly as intended. Program functionality will be marked based on the marking scheme available on the course website.

### Team Representation

Your team will be evaluated based on how well you represent your project's code and development. All of your team members should try to be present - but we understand that in some cases this will not be possible.

We expect you to be professional and prepared. This session is meant to minic interactions you might have with a project manager or client. With that, you should be familiar with the project's strenghts and weaknesses and be able to explain them in a thoughtful, detailed, and personable manner. 

Professionalism  
- Take ownership and responsibility for the project  
- Highlight positives but acknowledge drawbacks  
- Be on time  
- Be polite  
- Do not interrupt others  
- Be actively listening when not speaking  
- This is NOT the time to blame people or circumstances  
- This is a time to positively represent your software and achievements  
- Emotional regulation (i.e. donâ€™t get angry)  

The following is a list of example discussion points.
- Go over your class diagram, and lead me through how your system works.  
- How did your team use design patterns to organise your code?
- What benefits do you think your project has by implementing a REST API?
- Why did you decide to design your class interactions this way?  
- What other GUI designs did you consider, and why did you make the choice you did?  
- Can you change the look of X ?  
- Can you change the layout of X?  
- I would have liked to see X implemented, how long will adding that component take, and how would you go about it?  
- If you needed change to a different framework than Grails for your backend, how much of your project code could be reused? To what degree could you reuse a similar design in another system?  
- Are you aware of any security flaws in your application?
- If you needed to implement a version of your application compatible with Android or iOS, what code can and cannot be reused from your current project?
