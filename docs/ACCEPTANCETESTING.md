## Acceptance Testing  
**March 27th to 31st - Schedule and Room TBA**

Your team will attend a 30 to 45-minute evaluation session with Ethan and your TA. We will test your software and expect your team to answer questions about your project. 
We will ask questions about your code, tools and frameworks you have used, design decisions, team dynamics, and more. As many team members as possible should attend.Though you may have primary presenters, each person in attendance should tell us something about their role in the project.  

### Functional Testing

Part of the session will be used to test your software.  

Only the code cloned from your repository on Friday March 24th
