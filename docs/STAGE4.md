## Stage 2

[Home](README.md)  

***Due Friday April 7th at Midnight***  
Last updated March 2nd at noon.

This stage includes your code documentation, finalizes your readme, includes a project retrospective and requires you make a video demo of your software. Your submission will be in the form of an updated website, updated repository README.md, and a link to your YouTube video demonstration sent via e-mail to your TA - all by the due date listed above.

## New Website Page: Project Retrospective

For this part, you will add a page to your website to summarize how your project went from both a technical and teamwork perspective.  

This section should be aimed at other developers or a project manager, but can be somewhat casual and in point-form.  Assume the person is familiar with the technologies and the project, and that they can see your code and UML class diagram. Include each of the following sections.

### Workflow 

In this section you will describe the workflow your team used to do development.  
- What was the process or branching model each person used to pull, develop and push?  
- What development tools/frameworks did your project use?
- How effectively did your team manage task distribution among team members?

### MVC / Design Patterns
Describe how you made use of design patterns to help with the design and implementation of your project. 
- What is the relationship between user interfaces, application logic, and data in your project?  
- Did you implement your server-side program as a REST API?  
- Which collection of classes serve as the M, V, and C in MVC?  
- How do these classes communicate with each other? Give an example based on a user action.  
- If you were to start the project again today, what aspects of code organization could be improved in your project?  

### Refactor Retrospective 

In this section, suggest possible refactoring of your code in order to improve its design and software quality. 
Areas of your design that you felt were strong  
- Here is your chance to tell us all about that beautiful design you came up with in a particular area(s) of the application, and why it was so amazing. Tell us about a situation where good code organization helped you solve a problem or make your code significantly easier to read, understand, and use. Note: we’re talking about object-oriented design here – not GUI design.  You must include at least 2 parts you thought worked well.  

Areas of your design that you felt were weak
- In any large project, there are certain areas of the code that, after you finish implementing them, you really don’t want to venture back into as they may be fragile, inflexible, etc. Or you may have had trouble with them often. Tell us about one or two of these “dark corners” of your design. Discuss why you were unhappy with them, and how they could have been improved.  

### Project Retrospective
In this section, you will speak more to the overall project, rather than the code design.  They can include interpersonal communication, task and deadline management, UI design, frameworks/technologies, meeting management, etc. Be honest and professional in your answers.
- What did your group do well?  
- What could your group have done better?  
- What did you like about the tools and frameworks you used?
- What didn't you like about the tools and frameworks you used?

## Video Demonstration

You are to prepare a 2-4 minute narrated screencast demonstrating the various features of your application. This screencast is expected to be narrated and edited to a high degree of quality, and should be of high video and audio quality. The intent is to have a high-quality video to showcase your work. Create a video you would be proud to show a potential employer, investor, or other partner. 

- Upload the video to YouTube. You may make the video public or an unlisted video and provide us with the link. You may not make the video private, however, since we will not be able to access it.  
- You must leave the video on YouTube for at least 4 weeks. Ideally, you would leave it up indefinitely.  
- You do not have to personally identify yourselves in the video, but you should introduce yourself using the following language:  
  - We are members of Team X in the second-year Introduction to Software Engineering course in the Department of Computer Science at Western University, in London, Ontario, Canada.  
- You should then briefly discuss the development process.  
- Coded using frameworks and languages X, Y, and Z.  
- Used git for version control, and GitHub to host the project.  
- Used (Gradle/Maven/X) for build automation.  
- You should then demonstrate the functionality of your project, starting with the base functionality, then running through each additional component you have completed.  Show that data persists between runs.  
- Your video must be recorded in HD resolution (at least 720p).  
- Your video must be narrated and the audio must be of good quality (i.e. use a script)  
- You are not expected to use a program like Adobe After Effects to do advanced post-processing, but you are expected to have a video free of errors.  

Things that will lose you marks:
- Video is less than 2 minutes or longer than 4 minutes in duration.  
- Maintaining a pace that is either too slow (boring) or too fast (confusing).  
- Poor quality video/audio.  
- Low audio levels or digital distortion caused by levels that are too high.  
- Mistakes in your video that have not been edited out.  
- Really obvious edits – when editing something out, you should do so in a manner that is transparent to the viewer.
- Dead air in the video (use transitions to “fast-forward" between the start and end of time-consuming tasks that are not relevant to the video).
- Using unprofessional/cheesy transitions, such as Blinds, Curtains, etc.
- Sounding completely unscripted (e.g. lots of stuttering, “Uhh", “Um", etc.).
- Sounding completely scripted and unnatural (i.e. read, but try not to sound like a bad robot).
- Typing in gibberish or inappropriate/humourous/unprofessional data when performing your demo.
- Having all sorts of other programs open.
- Having an obnoxious wallpaper or names visible on your desktop, or a messy desktop. Show good computer hygiene.

## Updated GitHib README.md

After going through the acceptance testing process, make any changes to your repository's README.md that will help someone completely unaware of the project install and run your software. Use developer-friendly language to explain what steps would need to be followed for a new team member to install and run everything they need to work on the project.

For projects using Grails, this is very easy, since Gradle can be used to automatically resolve all dependencies, including JavaScript libraries. For less managed frameworks, make sure you explain how to install and configure any extra dependencies, such as database tools, IDEs, SDKs, etc.

Basically, it should be clear how a new contributor can get clone the project and get to working on it as easily as possible.
