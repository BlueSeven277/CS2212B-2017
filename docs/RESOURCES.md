Lots of tools mentioned that you might use together with [Grails](http://www.grails.org/) in your projects, especially for single-page web applications.

JavaFX is a completely acceptable framework you can use to develop your project front end / user interface. You might find it much easier to get started with than Grails/Groovy/JavaScript. Just be aware though, that JavaFX is not exactly popular in industry. JavaFX skills will be transferable to other frameworks, though, just with some effort.
