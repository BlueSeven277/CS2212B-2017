### Front-end / UI  

In this section I will post links about front-end / UI tools that you might use for your project. We will be spending some time covering [Grails](www.grails.org) in the course. Warning: developing a rich web application using Grails will be *very* challenging for beginners. But, MVC-based web frameworks have become a defacto standard design pattern in industry, and I feel obligated to expose you to it. Grails is one of the easiest web frameworks for Java programmers to learn and offers a rich set of flexible features. Start looking at the [documentation](http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/gettingStarted.html) and some third-party [tutorials](http://grails.asia/grails-tutorial-for-beginners/) to get a sense of what you're in for. Keep in mind that if you want to develop a truly *rich* web front-end (i.e. single-page web application) you'll need a team-member willing to spend some time learning more about JSON, REST APIs, and a compatible single-page web application framework such as [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) or [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Keep in mind that, though we will cover the basics of Groovy/Grails in-class, teams will be responsible for learning more advanced features independently. We could spend an entire semester on user interfaces written in AngularJS - but that is not the purpose of this course. Note also, that you are not by any means required to develop a single-page web application - this is just a project type I've already been asked about.

So, if you've read and reviewed the above and feel **completely overwhelmed**, don't worry. We will be discussing much of the above at a more conceptual level in class, and you are not *required* to use any of it to implement your projects. The core programming language of the course is still Java, and you can implement your project stricly in Java, using [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/) or [JavaFX](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/jfxpub-get_started.htm) for user interfaces.  

**To be clear:**  
A very well implemented UI in Swing or JavaFX can still earn **full marks** for the project, but when evaluating projects that use Grails ***effectively***, we will take into consideration the extra work required to learn the more complicated framework. 



[Grails gets cozy with AngularJS for better JavaScript](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2988234/javascript/grails-gets-cozy-with-angularjs-for-better-javascript.html)  
Lots of tools mentioned that you might use together with [Grails](http://www.grails.org/) in your projects, especially for single-page web applications.

[Sorry, JavaFX -- Java 8 won't help you matter](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2610802/java/sorry--javafx----java-8-won-t-help-you-matter.html)  
JavaFX is a completely acceptable framework you can use to develop your project front end / user interface. You might find it much easier to get started with than Grails/Groovy/JavaScript. Just be aware though, that JavaFX is not exactly popular in industry. JavaFX skills will be transferable to other frameworks, though, just with some effort.

### Git / GitHub

[Permission levels for a user account repository](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/)  
See here for information about collaborators on GitHub. There are a few solutions to repository hosting available to teams. For example, one team member could create a private repository and invite the other members as collaborators. Alternatively, teams may create an Organization profile and use a public repository. We also have the option of setting teams up with private repositories on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - an alternative repository hosting service that is very similar to and compatible with GitHub repositories.
