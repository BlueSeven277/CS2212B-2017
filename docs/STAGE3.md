## Stage 2

[Home](README.md)  

***Due Friday March 24th at Midnight***  
Last updated March 2nd at 10:00am.

This stage is your final software submission. Your GitHub repository's master branch will be cloned at midnight.  
No other code will be used to evaluate your project. Only features from your Stage 3 Spec will be marked.

## Website Updates  

Update your website to reflect the final state of your project on submission.  

On your Software Design Page, include an updated UML diagram that reflects the current state of your code.

On your Project Plan Page, clearly indicate what feature have been implemented, and have not been implemented. 
Again, note that you may not specify any additional features in Stage 3.

Otherwise, make sure your website satisfies the requirements

## GitHub  
You must continue to use GitHub effectively to manage your code.  

Requirements:    
- Issues must be marked as completed for implemented features.
- You must continue to use a proper branching model for development.
- Master branch should only contain evaluation-ready code.
- Your repository's README.md must give detailed installation and execution instructions.
- If you are using separate repositories for front and back ends, make sure it is explicitly clear how to install and run both parts of the project on a single computer.  

## Final Project Submission  

Your completed project is due with Stage 3. 

### Stage 3 Specification  

Your TA will send you a Stage 3 specification. This will be in a similar format to your specification for Stage 2. 
It will list every feature / functional specification you are expected to implement for Stage 3.

After Stage 2 is submitted, your TA will evaluate your team's progress and adjust your Stage 3 Spec accordingly.
If your team is progressing well, one or two of your team's advanced features may be added to your Spec. You will not 
be required to implement these - but we want to give you the opportunity. 

If your team is progressing with some difficulty, your TA may reduce the scope of your Stage 3 project or make other suggestions.
For example, a requirement such as *user-uploadable profile pictures* could be removed if your TA thinks your team might be unable get more important features implemented.

### Stage 3 Marking

Stage 3 marking will be complicated since you are all working on different projects. Your progress as a team will be used to set a maximum atteinable grade on Stage 3.
If no cuts or only minor cuts are made on your Stage 3 Spec, you can earn up to 100% of the 25 marks allocated for Stage 3. If several cuts are made, you can earn up to 90% or 22.5 marks. 
If major, extensive cuts are made, then you can earn up to 80% or 20 marks for Stage 3. These maximum atteinable marks will only be adjusted in cases where we feel that intervention
is necessary to make project completion possible. If your team feels that your Stage 3 Spec has been unfairly cut, you can appeal the decision to your instructor or TA.
In such cases, you will need to convince us that you will be able to make more progress on Stage 3 than was made on Stage 2.

The bulk of your marks for Stage 3 will be a result of [Acceptance Testing](/CS2212-2017/docs/ACCEPTANCETESTING.md).

### Stage 3 Submission

Your Stage 3 submission is your updated GitHub repository master branch at midnight on Friday March 24th. Your TA will clone your repository
and will begin inspecting your code. Only the code cloned from your repository on Friday March 24th will be used for evaluation - *no exceptions*.


Notes:  
- If your team is using multiple repositories (e.g. for front and back ends) your TA **must have agreed** to this setup.
- It is your responsibility to ensure the TA knows about any special instructions needed to clone your project.
- You must make sure (i.e. test) that your cloned repository can easily be built and executed on other computers. 
- IntelliJ configuration/settings for Gradle, Maven, JDK, etc. may be modified during testing if there are problems, but it is your responsibility to know how to do this.
